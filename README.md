# Customer Analysis for Retail

## About the problem
A retail store is required to analyze the day-to-day transactions and keep a track of its customers spread across various locations along with their purchases/returns across various categories.
I've created a RMarkdown Report that shows various calculated metrics, reports and inferences.

## About Data
The following sheets are used in the analysis:
1. *Customer:* Customers information including demographics
2. Transaction: Transactions of customers
3. Product Hierarchy: Product information (category, sub category etc....)
